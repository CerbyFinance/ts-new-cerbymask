# TODOs

- Adapt logic to RxJS (now we're using Promises and raw `subscribe` output from observables.
- Remove `any` and improve TypeScript base
- Create a general user authorization listener within every network that updates a bunch of all the necessary data related to that particular network (user balances, stakes, etc.)
